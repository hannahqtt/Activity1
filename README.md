This repository contains my Python project for Graphics and Visual Computing, where I created a digital artwork of a First Aiders Guild Trophy using the Pillow library. The program generates a colorful trophy design that includes a golden medal, a red cross symbol, colorful ribbons, and recognition text that is automatically resized to fit neatly inside the medal and plaque. The project reflects the intramural theme by highlighting the dedication and importance of medics during the events.

The code demonstrates my understanding of image manipulation in Python, such as drawing shapes, adding text with outlines, layering objects, and applying color designs. I also learned how to ensure that text fits within specific areas without overlapping, which improved both the accuracy and creativity of the final output.
