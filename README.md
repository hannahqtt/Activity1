Theme: 
Intramurals 2025 Trophy design

Artwork Title  
First Aiders Guild Trophy

Brief Description of Your Concept
A colorful, medical-themed trophy design for the First Aiders Guild  that celebrates the dedication of medics in the intramurals. The artwork features a golden medal with a prominent red cross and ECG heartbeat line to symbolize medical care, multi-colored ribbons to represent team energy and diversity, and a clear two-line title “FIRST AIDERS GUILD” centered within the medal. The piece demonstrates how simple geometric shapes and programmatic drawing  can produce a polished recognition graphic.

What did you learn from this activity? 
From this activity, I learned how to combine programming skills with creativity by using the Python Pillow library to design a digital trophy. I explored how shapes, colors, and text can be drawn and adjusted dynamically through code. I also understood the importance of auto-fitting text within specific areas, preventing overlaps and ensuring the design looks neat and professional. Most importantly, I realized that coding can also be a tool for artistic expression and recognition, not just for solving technical problems.
